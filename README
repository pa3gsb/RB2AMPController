# Radioberry AMP Controller Board by PA3GSB

RB2AMPController (Radioberry V2.0 Amplifier Controller)

The board contains an ethernet module and a Raspberry Pi Pico (RP2040) module which implemets a TCPIP server.

The radioberry firmware talks to the controller server using a TCPIP client.

The information in the openhpsdr protocol-1 is used to control the amplifier. So if you change the frequency in your favourite SDR program the LPF filter
in the AMP will be set. Also when going into transmit; the AMP will make use of a sequencer and will switch the relais in the right order.

Information of the AMP will be placed into the protocol and will be presented in the SDR program user interface to the operator.
Information here is the temperature of the AMP, the forward and reverse power.


This controller board supports works for now only with the radioberry juice board.

## Firmware of the RB2AMPController
The RPI pico board contains a microcontroller which need a firmware.

For loading this firmware you need to connect a USB cable to the board.
Push the button on the Pico and then plug the USB cable into your PC.
The Pico will appear as a flash drive on the PC. Then copy the file xxx.uf2 to the Pico. 

The Pico will reboot and the Pico LED will flash slowly.
